Volunteer Manager is a Swift-based project that helps manage basic volunteer information such as name, phone number, email, and age. The project ensures data validation using key Swift programming concepts like:

Structs to model volunteer data.
Error Handling to validate phone numbers, checking both length and numeric content.
Protocols to describe volunteer information using CustomStringConvertible.
The main features of the project include:

Adding new volunteers.
Ensuring phone numbers are valid, containing exactly 10 digits and no non-numeric characters.
Displaying volunteer details in a readable format.
This project aims to strengthen understanding of Swift fundamentals and improve problem-solving skills while working with real-world data management. Itâ€™s ideal for anyone looking to practice Swift programming and handle data validation effectively.
